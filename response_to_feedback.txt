Hey thanks for the great feedback!

I've implemented v2.2.2 with your suggestions:
✅ **Types**: Switched to `$app.AL_BaseAnime` instead of `any`.
✅ **Logic**: Removed the redundant API fetching, now relying purely on `media.idMal`.

Regarding the **DOM injection**:
I actually tried implementing it (injecting the button directly next to the AL icon), but the Seanime sandbox is pretty strict—it blocked `MutationObserver` and `setInterval`, which caused the extension to crash. So I've decided to stick with the Tray UI for now to ensure stability.

Thanks again for the code review! 🚀
